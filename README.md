# LibDE
Generic Desktop Environment Libraries for Linux

LibDE is a work-in-progress set of libraries that aim to make creating graphical applications for desktop environments easier! LibDE is written in Rust, but the goal is to eventually create C bindings for these libraries, so that users may choose their own language of choice to use LibDE in!

Currently the planned libraries include:

* libde-daemon A daemon library for managing brightness, volume, notifications, and much more
* [libde-files](https://github.com/generic-desktops/libde-files) A file manager library
* libde-store An app store / app management library - will include flatpak, packagekit, and appstream integration
* libde-settings A settings library that may optionally hook into libde-daemon
